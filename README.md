# Search Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in Python.

## Algorithms Implemented

This repository includes implementations of:

* **Binary Search:** An efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** A graph traversal algorithm.
* **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Another graph traversal algorithm.
* **Exponential Search:** A search algorithm for unbounded sorted arrays.
* **Fibonacci Search:** A search algorithm that uses Fibonacci numbers. (With Animated Visualization)
* **Interpolation Search:** A search algorithm for uniformly distributed sorted arrays.
* **Jump Search:** A search algorithm for sorted arrays. (With Visualization)
* **Linear Search:** A basic search algorithm that sequentially checks each element.
* **Sublist Search:** Algorithm to find if one list is a sublist of another.

## Usage

Each Python file contains the implementation of a specific search algorithm.
